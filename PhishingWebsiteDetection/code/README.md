# Phising-Classifier

Classification methodology to predict whether a website is a phishing website.

Tremendous resources are spent by organizations guarding against and recovering from cybersecurity attacks by online hackers who gain access to sensitive and valuable user data.
In a phishing attack emails are sent to user claiming to be a legitimate organization, where in the email asks user to enter information like name, telephone, bank account number important passwords etc. such emails direct the user to a website where in user enters these personal information. These websites steal the entered user information and carries out illegal transactions thus causing harm to the user. Phishing website and their mails are sent to millions of users daily and thus are still a big concern for cyber security.

We have used machine learning classification algorithms to validate whether website is legitimate thus protecting the client from any further phishing attacks.

##Algorithm used: 
 *XGBoost
 *SVM
